### How to Break a Curse
 
What if you think you are under a curse? How can you break it and free yourself from its negative effects? There are many methods and rituals that claim to break curses, but some of the most common ones involve the use of water, salt, candles, herbs and prayers.
 
One of the simplest ways to break a curse is to use a bowl of water and a taper candle. According to wikiHow[^1^], you should fill a bowl with water and place a taper candle into the center of it, so that it sticks out about an inch. Next, sprinkle some salt into the water. Then, light the candle and close your eyes to visualize the water being illuminated with light. Say a prayer or affirmation to remove the curse from yourself and send it back to its source. Let the candle burn until it goes out by itself.
 
Another way to break a curse is to use herbs that have cleansing and protective properties, such as sage, rosemary, lavender or basil. You can either burn them as incense, make them into a tea or bath, or carry them in a pouch. As you use the herbs, you should focus on your intention to break the curse and shield yourself from harm.
 
A third way to break a curse is to use a mirror or a reflective object. You can either wear a mirror pendant, place a mirror in front of your door or window, or hold a mirror in your hand. The idea is to reflect the curse back to its sender and prevent it from reaching you. You can also say a mantra or a spell to reinforce this effect.
 
### How to Prevent Curses
 
The best way to avoid curses is to prevent them from happening in the first place. This means being careful about who you interact with, what you say and do, and how you treat others. Here are some tips to prevent curses:
 
- Avoid offending or harming anyone who might have the ability or desire to curse you. This includes people who practice witchcraft, voodoo, black magic or other forms of sorcery.
- Avoid accepting gifts or objects from strangers or enemies that might be cursed or have negative energy attached to them. This includes jewelry, clothing, dolls, books or anything else that might have a hidden meaning or purpose.
- Avoid participating in activities or rituals that might expose you to curses or evil spirits. This includes playing with ouija boards, tarot cards, seances, spells or anything else that might open a portal to the unseen realm.
- Wear or carry protective amulets or charms that can ward off curses or evil influences. This includes crystals, metals, symbols, herbs or anything else that has a positive vibration or meaning for you.
- Pray or meditate regularly to strengthen your connection with your higher power and your inner guidance. This can help you discern between good and evil forces and protect you from harm.
